# Image gallery
A Qt-based gallery application for image slide shows.


# Features
## Choosing files and folders
Launching the application opens a file picker, where the user can choose individual files or folders to display in their slide show. A mixture of files and folders is supported.

Default directory is the user's home folder.

Note that double-clicking a folder moves into it. A folder can be chosen for a slide show by selecting to highlight it, and pressing **Open**. Folders are processed recursively.

*Currently supported file extensions are jpg, jpeg, png, gif, svg, and webp.*

## Controls
The slide show timer can be toggled on and off by pressing **P**.
The default state is off and the interval between images is 6 seconds.

Moving left and right between images is performed by pressing **J** and **K**, respectively. Mouse controls include arrows on left and right edges on the window and a button row in the middle bottom area. 

A slide show and the application can be closed by pressing **Q** and rebooted by pressing **N**.
